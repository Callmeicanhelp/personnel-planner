# Personnel Planner

Welcome to the Personnel Planner application.

This application was created with node.js in VSCode and utilized the express and inquirer libraries with a MYSQL2 database.

Personnel planner is a great way to track information about your workforce, including employees and their salaries, the positions they are filling, and the departments which those positions are assigned to.

View Employees, Positions, and Departments as three separate tables of data.

This application requires the installing of node.js by runing the commmand "npm install express mysql2 inuirer" in the root folder.

Personnel Planner can be ran from the command line using the command "npm start".
